One of the earliest projects I did as I was learning Unix, starting with ZSH on my Macbook. I wrote a little plugin for oh-my-zsh that pulls a Marx quote with each new terminal session and adds some beautiful red imagery to your terminal. 

In the future I want to add more quotes and probably have configuration options for a much smaller hammer & sickle - more to come :)
