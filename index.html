<h3>Hi,</h3>
<p>I'm Victoria, a software dev & student based in San Francisco. I'm a transfer-track CS major at CCSF planning on swapping into data science at USF in Spring 2023, but applying to multiple schools around the Bay Area. I did one enlistment in the USAF ending in 2021 and have been in school and/or a part-time barista since.</p>

<p>I know Javascript, Python, C++ and have previously done freelance and organizational webdev work. I also do A/V and really enjoy hardware projects. Recently Iâ€™ve gotten really into Obsidian notetaking and arch linux.</p>
