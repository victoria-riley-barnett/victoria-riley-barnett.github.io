<h2 id="hi">Hi,</h2>
<p>I'm Victoria, a software dev & student based in San Francisco. I'm a CS major in my final semester at San Francisco State University. I did one enlistment in the U.S. Air Force ending in 2021, and have been in school ever since. I'm focused on building my skills in software development, particularly in machine learning & natural language processing, embedded software, and web development.</p>

<p>I know Javascript, Python, C++, Java, R and MIPs and have previously done freelance and organizational webdev and ITwork. I also do events A/V, and really enjoy hardware projects - I like to know the functional side of how everything works! Recently Iâ€™ve gotten really into Obsidian notetaking and arch linux, and I'm trying to slowly force myself onto nvim and off of VS Code.</p>

<p>I'm actively applying and hunting for internships and/or junior positions while I finish school - feel free to <a href="/about/#contact-me">reach out to me!</a></p>
