<h2 id="hi">Hi,</h2>
<p>I'm Victoria, a software dev & student based in San Francisco. I'm a CS major at City College of San Francisco, planning on swapping into Data Science at either USF or SF State in Spring 2024, but I'm applying to multiple schools around the Bay Area. I did one enlistment in the U.S. Air Force ending in 2021 and have been in school and/or a part-time barista since then.</p>

<p>I know Javascript, Python, C++ and have previously done freelance and organizational webdev work. I also do events A/V, and really enjoy hardware projects - I like to know the functional side of how everything works! Recently Iâ€™ve gotten really into Obsidian notetaking and arch linux, and I'm trying to slowly force myself onto Vim and off of VS Code.</p>

<p>I'm actively applying and hunting for an internship for Summer 2023 and/or a position while I continue school - feel free to <a href="/about/#contact-me">reach out to me!</a></p>
